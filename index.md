## About me

Hello there,

I'm currently a graduate student at University of Florida, majoring in Electrical Engineering. I focus mainly on signal processing and communication systems. I like to code in Python, specifically involving digital signal processing and data analysis. My current goal is to learn as much as possible about software-defined radios, specifically how to use them for communication networks applications.

I'm currently interning for Analog Devices Inc. as a Digital Design Engineering Intern. My job is to model Crest Factor Reduction (CFR) stage in next gen transceiver using MATLAB.

For my recent research, I also worked with Network Simulator 3 (NS-3) to simulate various network topologies, implement various traffic, and gather timing data.

I've been a teaching assistant more than 2 years, for courses involving signal processing, probability theory, and communication theory. When teaching, I try to inspire understanding.

I often browse [Kaggle](kaggle.com), looking for interesting datasets to analyze, maybe construct visualization tools, maybe implement simple machine learning.

Sometimes my work, research, or teaching inspire me to create various engineering tools, hopefully support fellow engineers around the world.
